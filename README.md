# quiz

In this project I created a quiz on coding with a timer and leader board that tracks scores with names.

There are 4 HTML files, 4 CSS files, and 4 JavaScript files that create the webpage.

I had trouble with the JavaScript and would like to continue working to get better at it. At times, connecting the CSS and JS files to the HTML was difficult, but I think I understand it better now.
